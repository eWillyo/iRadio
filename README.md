# iRadio
 
For this project you need linux based system (e.g. Raspberry OS), some new version of Python3, VLC player installed on your system and via pip installed Python binding for VLC (python-vlc). You can improve iRadio with text-to-speech software Festival. I used it here to report names of radio stations.
