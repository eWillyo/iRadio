# iRadio
 
For this project you need Linux based system (e.g. Raspberry OS), some new version of Python 3 interpreter, VLC player installed on your system and via pip installed Python binding for VLC (python-vlc):

         sudo pip3 install python-vlc
         
You can improve iRadio with text-to-speech software - Festival. I used it here to report names of radio stations:

         sudo apt-get update
         sudo apt-get install festival 
  
Think about control iRadio with some remote controller connected to your Raspberry Pi.. ;-)
